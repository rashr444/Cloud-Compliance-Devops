# Cloud Compliance DevOps Project


This project demonstrates how to build a secure, compliant, and automated cloud infrastructure using:

    Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)
    GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
    Docker + Cloud Run (App Deployment)
    GCP Services (SQL, IAM, KMS, Secret Manager, Logging & Monitoring)
    Compliance Mapping (ISO 27001, GDPR, COBIT, DORA)

Itâ€™s designed as a portfolio-ready project that shows both DevOps skills and GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) knowledge.
